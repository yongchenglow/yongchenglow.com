This is because it directly affects how our users use the application. How our website looks, feel and functions also plays a major factor in user retention. If you work at a big company, the role of designing the user interface is left to the product designers. If a company has multiple products, they will usually have a core design team that will create something called a design system to be used throughout the entire company. This ensures that the user experience remain similar across all the company's products. An example of this is Apple, the design system between the Mac, iPad, and iPhone share the same design language making their users feel comfortable as they switch between these products. In this article, we will cover more about how the web interface is designed and a basic matrix on how we can evaluate a user interface. This will help you understand the different terminologies, the process and the standards that is being used in the industry. This will allow engineers and designers to work together to create a better product. We will leave the creation of design system and other higher level items for another day. What is Design? Design is solving problems given a set of constrains The definition of design is very controversial as different sources will explain things a bit differently. However, in order for us to speak the same language, for this article, this is the definition which we will used that I learned from my time at NUS. What this definition of design means is that a good design will take into considerations of not only the users, the but resources we have. This includes, time, cost, and technology etc. A designer that comes up with a super elegant and fancy user interface in 10 days and in return takes 5 senior engineers 3 months to create. However, according to our definition, this can be a bad design because a company might not have the resources to afford the designers 10 days to create it and pay 3 senior engineers for 3 months to create on feature. A good designer will take into considerations of the different constrains such as time, cost, manpower before creating the final design. Design thinking [](https://developerexperience.io/practices/design-thinking) Design thinking is a human-centred, collaborative problem-solving approach that is creative, iterative and practical. Ideo is a design consulting firm famous for using this approach to help companies create wonderful products. Design thinking is a 5 step process as shown in the picture above. Empathize is about understand the user's needs and goals. This is the stage where the designer conducts user interviews to find out more about how the users feel and what are their frustrations or pain points. Define is identifying the problem base on the users' needs and goals. Using the information gathered from the empathy phase, the designers then defines a problem statement. The designers can create something called a user journey map to help visualize the problem. Personas can also be created to understand the different user groups, interests and goals. If there are a lot of problems identified from the user interviews, the problems are ranked in terms of severity and the Product Owner would then choose one of the most severe one to work on. Ideate is to coming up with ideas to solve the problem. During this phase, it is important to note that there are no ridiculous or stupid ideas. Everything goes onto the brainstorming board. It is helpful during this phase to have the user journey map and the personas visible so that we stay focused on the problem. Prototyping is creating a mock-up of the product that can be tested by the users. We will talk more about the different kind of prototypes in the next section. Test the product with relevant users and gather feedback. Repeat this process if necessary. If the users don't like the prototype, or don't think that the proposed product will resolve the problem, don't waste the engineering effort to build the product, it would be a waste of time, resources and money. Prototyping Prototyping is one of the most important phase of design thinking. After passing the user test, a prototype might need some touch ups before passing it onto the engineering team. In general there are 3 kinds of prototypes: 1. Quick & Dirty 2. Low Fidelity 3. High Fidelity [](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1929849&seqNum=5) A Quick & Dirty prototype is something that can be done really quickly, even by using a pen and paper. It gives you a basic visualization of what the user or client wants. It should include basic information, some of the page flow and different sections of the pages. This is usually done up quickly to have a visual understanding of what a product will look like. [](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/low-fidelity-vs-high-fidelity-prototypes/) A low fidelity prototype focuses on the layout and concepts. These are the big items or in web design, the different portions of the webpage. It is usually done using some kind of prototyping tool such as Figma, Invision or AdobeXD. The low fidelity prototype is usually sent to the client or users for review. For smaller features, a high fidelity prototype may be created without the user's or client's review. [](https://www.justinmind.com/blog/low-fidelity-vs-high-fidelity-prototypes/) A high fidelity prototype is almost like the final product, however it lacks backend functionality and full user interactions. This is what the frontend engineers usually reference when they try to create the website in code. It is almost like the final product except it done in a prototyping software's mentioned above. From a web development perspective, a high fidelity prototype should be confirmed during sprint planning phase. This will allow the developmental work to be completed smoothly. The more changes there is to the High Fidelity prototype during the sprint, the greater the risk of the team not being able to achieve the sprint goal. Facets of Web Design [](https://eu.landisgyr.com/better-tech/usability-is-a-key-element-of-user-experience) While prototyping is important, what do designers take into considerations when creating a prototype for a feature? How do we judge if a product is good or user friendly? While there are more advance metrics such as nelson's heuristics, we will stick to these 6 principles to keep things simple. | Facets | Description | |--------|-------------| | Effectiveness | Can the users achieve their goal? | | Efficiency | How quickly can the users achieve their goal? | | Learnability | Is it easy for the users to learn the first time? | | Memorability | How easily can repeated users know how to use your site? | | Handling | how well does the website allow users to recover from errors | | Satisfaction | how satisfied are the users and will they recommend it to others | These are the things that we can look out for when we conduct our user interviews. The unit of measurement is highly depended on the task. For example effectiveness can be either yes or no, or if it is broken down into smaller sub task then the scoring metrics will be a bit different. It is important to note that once a unit of measurement is chosen, it shall remain constant so that in the next iteration we can compare the results to see if the design had made any improvements. For example for efficiency, we can compare 2 prototypes as see if there is a reduced number of clicks or a reduction in time for the user to complete a particular task. Conclusion Overall, I have scraped the surface of designing a user interface, and for beginning who what just stepped into the web development this should be sufficient. This comes to the end of our content on the Sprint Planning session. In the next few articles it will be more code heavy and less content heavy. Together we will go through a basic repository setup process on GitHub that will impress your technical accessors.","tags":["design","ui-ux","prototyping","user-experience","design-thinking"],"date":"2022-03-09","url":"/blog/designing-the-interface"},"its-story-time":{"id":"its-story-time","title":"It's Story Time","subtitle":"Creating a Product Plan for success","description":"Learn how to create effective product plans using personas, user stories, and the initiative-epic-story breakdown approach for successful sprint planning.","content":"You just learned about scrum and feel confident to start your Sprint Planning session. However, what exactly does Sprint Planning consist of? How do we decide what features are going to be built in the current sprint? What are the outcomes of a Sprint Planning session? Before I start talking about the Sprint Planning process, I would like us to take a step back and look at the big picture. Instead of focusing on one sprint, lets focus on the product that we are building first. This is so that we know what we are working towards after the completion of multiple sprints. Every product that a company build is paid for by a particular user. Therefore, before doing any planning, we first need to revisit who our users are. This is because if we start deviating from their needs and wants, they will eventually look for a close substitute. What are Personas? [](/img/4317364.jpg) Personas are fictional characters that are created to represent the different user groups of your product. Personas help us understand the user's needs, wants and goals. By creating the persona, we understand who we are building the product for. Using a very basic Airbnb as an example, we can start with 2 personas, a home owner and traveler. The smaller the company is, the more specific the Personas are. A product is usually niche at the start, but as they flourish, the characteristics of the personas becomes broader and cover a wider audience. Some companies grow so big that they do not see the need for Personas. However, my personal opinion is, it is always important to revisit the persona to understand your core audience. This is because if you have been playing the game of business long enough, a close substitute will eventually come along. When this happens, it is natural that some of these users will flood to your competitor's product. On the other hand, if you do things right and meet the needs and wants of your core user group, they will stay. An example of this will be Instagram. Instagram targets people generally below the age of 35 who want to share great photos or story moments with a certain network. When TikTok emerged, those who use Instagram to create content or skits flocked over as they are their targeted user groups. Only by understanding this, you realize that Instagram and TikTok are not really true competitors as they target a different set of audience. However, because TikTok did not exist before 2016, these creators did not have a choice but to use Instagram. Yes, yes you may say Instagram should have identified these persona's earlier and perhaps adjust their product to cater for these users. However, we won't be debating about this, but this is why it is important to constantly conduct user research to understand the demographics of the users and what are your users using the product for. UI/UX researchers are usually the ones creating and refining the personas from time to time to ensure that they accurately represent the current users of your product. Only after understanding our users, we can then start to plan out our initiatives. Breaking down the Initiative [](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics-stories-themes) Whenever the team wants to build something special, you will need to draw out some kind of game plan. One of the most popular ways to organize your work is through initiatives, epics, stories, task, sub-task. This is a very user centric approach as each task completed will satisfy some of the user needs and wants. An Initiative is a product goal. It can be further broken down into multiple epics to be worked on An Epic breaks the Initiative down into smaller parts. It contains a collection of user stories or things that the user can do with your product after it is completed Stories or User stories are requirements from the perspective of the end users A Task is a breakdown of a story into smaller tasks. A Sub-task is a breakdown of a task Some of the popular project management tools includes Jira, Click up, Notion, Asana and Monday. All the different products have their own advantages and limitations which we will not discuss. However, from my personal experience, it is better for a company or team stick to a single tool, meaning to say if one team uses Jira, the rest should use it too. Or else managing scaled up scrum where one team is using notion and another is using Jira will turn into a nightmare. Lastly, before we start any sprint planning, the team needs to decide and have a common understanding of the Definition of Done. Definition of Done Definition of Done is the acceptance criteria to a particular type of user story A huge caveat before we proceed is that according to the scrum guide, the definition of done should apply for every user story. However, from experience a Design Task has a very different acceptance criteria from Developer Task or a Quality Assurance(QA) Task. At the end of the day, the team must have a common consensus on the definition of done for the different kinds of task. This is so that when a task is marked as Done, the team all have a common understand what each task has gone through. An example of a Design Task may be to conduct AB testing on 2 different designs. The definition of done of a design task may include: 1. Create 2 variations of a design of the particular page each following two different sets of design principles 2. Conduct user research on at least 3 users 3. Draw a conclusion on which design to choose base on the supported evidence An example of a QA Task may be to investigate a particular bug report filed by one of our users. The definition of done of a QA task may include: 1. Replicate the bug on staging environment 2. Create a Bug report 3. Fix the Bug 4. Write a unit test for the bug 5. Release the bug fix to staging 6. Test the bug fix on staging 7. Release the bug fix to production 8. Inform the users that the bug has been fixed An example of a Developer task may be to create a login page. The definition of done of a developer task may include. 1. Create an approve wireframe for the task and for the different user flow 2. Write the necessary unit test for frontend 3. Write the necessary unit test for backend 4. Write the necessary integration test to ensure that the feature work 5. Pass performance testing 6. Pass penetration testing 7. Pass QA 8. Pass Code Review 9. Write the necessary documentation 10. Release to Staging 11. Pass QA Staging 12. Release to Production Sprint Planning Now that we have talked about the different terminologies, it's time talk about the Sprint Planning session itself. At the start of the Sprint Planning meeting, the team needs to decide on the what. The product owner pick items from the backlog that the team will be working on and sets the initial sprint goal. These items are usually picked because they are related to the initiative and epics of the previous sprint or because are starting a new one. The development team will then plan out the how, or the scoping and specifications needed to deliver the sprint goal. It is important that this process is a negotiation, if the work is too much, we need to adjust the what. But at the end of the day, the scope of work must be manageable and the team must agree that the items pick can meet the definition of done by the end of the sprint. Once the sprint goal is finalized and the scope of work is final, the team then decides the who, in other words who takes which task. This process is done purely by the development team. In most companies, the how portion is where most controversies arise. Don't worry if it turns into a negotiation and tensions may arise. Good teams will know how to use this tension to make the product better. This is because everybody is thinking for the product itself, and a simple task may become very complicated if done correctly to make it future proof. There are also companies that run the top-down approach where bosses just say, I don't care how, just complete this set of work within a given time. This is where you start to build products in the fastest way possible almost as if you are back in a bootcamp. For short lived projects or products that mean to last 1 to 2 years max that are only used by 100 to 1000 users you will be quite safe. However, for project maintenance and adjustments, it is likely that just by reading the code, you will want to jump off a building. In my opinion, the top-down approach is what is causing the great resignation. Because maintenance is going to be super difficult, during the maintenance stage, the original developers usually leave the company. The company then hires new people to maintain the product. If you go to Google and just type coding memes, you may laugh at first, but those are actually true stories no matter how fake they seem. Once the people are tired of pulling their hair out to solve problems they leave and the process starts all over again. In conclusion, we have learned a lot today about project planning. It might have been an information overload so you may need to read the article a couple of times to understand. In the next article, we will be focusing on \"the how\" portion of the Spring Planning, and why a simple task may seem more complex than it is, in particular, it is all because of the database.","tags":["agile","sprint-planning","user-stories","product-management"],"date":"2022-03-02","url":"/blog/its-story-time"},"join-the-scrum":{"id":"join-the-scrum","title":"Join the Scrum","subtitle":"How do development teams work?","description":"Understanding how development teams work using the Scrum framework, including team structure, rituals, and best practices for agile development.","content":"When a development team starts to build a web application, what do you think is the first thing they do? Do they start by writing code? Don't think so? Then how do you think a typical development team work? What rituals should a team follow so that they can deliver a high-quality piece of software at record breaking time. Most development teams work using some kind of Agile methodology. One of the most common framework in the industry that adopts this is Scrum. By adhering to the Scrum framework, the team delivers software in an incremental manner. This gives stakeholders the flexibility to review the increment periodically and make adjustments if necessary. An increment is a working, production ready piece of software. Now, before we go on any further, I would first like to manage your expectations. What I am about to describe to you is my own interpretation and what I find works best for the teams that I have worked for. By no means you should quote me or tell your employers this should be the way things are done. Instead, you should be using this article to understand the different concepts and how they work. It is also important to understand that each team works a bit differently. Hence, they should adjust the Scrum framework to utilize the strength of all of their team members. To find out exactly how Scrum works, you can read the scrum guide for detailed information. But let me give you a brief overview, in my own definition, for a basic understanding. What is Scrum? A scrum team consist of a maximum of 10 people containing: - 1 Product Owner - 1 Scrum Master - The Development Team The Product Owner owns the product backlog or a to do list and makes executive product decisions based on the client and the business needs. The Scrum master is responsible to facilitate, advocate and coach the teams to ensure that the scrum teams are adhering to the scrum rules and are working at the stable velocity. The Development Team a self-organized team, consisting of many cross-functional members responsible for the development of the product. It is important to note that the development team does not only contain software engineers, but whoever is needed to complete the task at hand. Although this means that members can easily come and go, it is important to consider the loss in working velocity when onboarding a new member, or when losing someone with experience. Some of the more common roles that you may see in a Development Team includes: - Project Manager - Designers - UI/UX Researcher - Backend Engineer - Frontend Engineer - Security Engineer - Devops Engineer - Quality Assurance Engineer - Hardware Engineer - Data Scientist - Business Analyst - Database Admin - Tech Lead - Tech Anchor - Architect Each team member has a slightly different role and don't be surprised if a person has to take up multiple roles. It is also important to understand that a team does not need to consist of all the roles mentioned above. If you want to find out more about some of the roles above and the skills needed, I recommend you visit roadmap. Take note that the site is still under development by the open source community but definitely a great site to explore. Scaling Up Now you may be wondering, wait a minute if a scrum team can have only 10 people, how come tech companies are so big? The answer is Scaled up Scrum. A Product Owner and a Scrum Master can be running one or multiple Scrum teams. Using the Airbnb products of hosting, experience and online experience as an example, it is possible that they are running scaled up Scrum with each scrum team working on a certain product: 1. Traveler 2. Host 3. Experience customers 4. Experience teachers 5. Online experience customer 6. Online experience host 7. Online experience livestream service As Airbnb grow even further, they may split the teams mentioned above into smaller teams and have a product owner to manage each service. The following is an example of the services that the Traveler Product may offer that each Scrum team may work on: 1. Payment Gateway 2. Booking 3. Search 4. Automations e.g. reminders and emails 5. Authentication Scrum Rituals A Scrum team will produce a working increment over a course of 1-4 weeks known as a Sprint. The sprint length is usually kept consistent in order to cultivate a habit and a routine product release. The following are the different kinds of Sprint rituals that a team will typically have: | Event | Max Duration | Frequency | Compulsory Attendees | |-------|--------------|-----------|----------------------| | Sprint Planning | 2 hours per week | Once per sprint | All | | Daily Scrum | 15 mins per day | Daily | Development Team | | Sprint Review | 1 hour per week | Once per sprint | All | | Sprint Retrospective | 45 mins per week | Once per sprint | All | E.g. A 4 week sprint should have a maximum of 2x4=8 hours of Sprint Planning Sprint Planning is the preparation work done before we can start the sprint. The team will re-prioritize the Product Backlog and select items to be placed in the Sprint Goal that they commit to completed by the end of the sprint. This is also where the development team draw out a detailed plan on how to achieve the sprint goal. The Daily Scrum is a meeting to monitor the progress of work and identify any blockers. Each person has to answer 3 questions during the meeting: 1. What did you do yesterday? 2. What will you be doing today? 3. Are there any impediments in the way? Sprint Review is the where the increment created from the sprint is showcased to the stakeholders. Stakeholders can inspect the work and raise questions or concerns or raise adjustments. Sprint Retrospective is a meeting that allows the team to reflect on how they work over the past sprint. The 3 questions that the team have to answer are: 1. What went well? 2. What didn't go so well? 3. What can we do differently to improve our working velocity in the next sprint? Additional Rituals There are some companies that add additional rituals to ensure that the team can work at a stable velocity. These include: Mid Sprint Review is usually done at the middle of the sprint. This is to check if there are any risk of not being able to meet the sprint goal. If there are any, make the necessary adjustments. A Tech Bounce may be needed if the development team is not full of technical engineers. This session is basically taken out of the Sprint Planning time to align on the technical specifications such as the database design, Api request and response, frontend and backend validations etc. This ensures that the tech team is all on the same page so that frontend and backend can be built concurrently. Those that are not involved in the Tech Bounce will be doing their own version of Tech bounce, e.g. Designers, UX researchers will align on the Discovery Task and Hypothesis, QA may be planning out on what they need to do to strengthen the automation testing. Tech Spike may be done before the tech bounce to ensure the design of the tech for the current or next sprint is efficient and scalable. Some examples include database designs, optimizations to the web application, vulnerability research etc. Conclusion From my personal experience, I find the scrum rituals to be much more effective when working remotely. This is because at a remote workplace, everyone is usually working at their own pace, therefore the rituals serves as a common timing for us to check in on each other. In a physical workplace, especially if your team sits in the same room and constantly talks to each other, rituals such as the Daily Scrum may become ineffective. It is also important to note that although Scrum is one of the most popular ways of delivering a piece of software, there are other agile frameworks that a company may use. Some companies also don't adopt the agile workflow and prefer to work more towards the waterfall method. So if your company decides how you work, how will this article help you? In my opinion, if you are given a take home assignment, joining a hackathon, or starting a new side project, the scrum framework is something that you should modify off to delivery software. How do you apply scrum in your projects? Well, unfortunately you will have to read the next few articles to find out. In conclusion, I have scraped the surface of what is Scrum, what the teams are made up of and the different rituals that a team will follow. The next few articles will be focused around Sprint Planning. These will include user stories, database design and wireframes before we move on to the actual coding stuff. For those of you who are die hard coders, I ask for you all to bear with me a little while longer. It is important to understand that the industry is moving away from focusing on the speed of delivery, and focusing more on the quality of the delivery. From your coding bootcamp or university education you should be able to see that creating a web application is easy, but the question is, how do we write code that is clean, efficient and scalable? That is something you have to stay around to find out.

You go over to Glints, apply for a software engineering job and demand a 5k starting salary. How Naive. Don't worry, I was once like you! Having been in the industry for close to 3 years and helped close to 60 people get their first job in web development, I feel that it's a good time for me to share my experience to aspiring developers. Don't get me wrong, your coding skills is important! However, your soft skills and how you present yourself during interviews is equally important. I have seen students who know their stuff inside out but they are just not good at selling themselves. This series will be a guide, on how you can prepare for your first software engineering role. It will help you understand what hiring managers are looking for and how you can prepare for it. Having been through the job hunting process myself, being involved in the hiring process with my company and teaching programming to aspiring developers, I will give you my perspective from 3 different angles.

However before I start my web series, let me introduce myself so that you can understand who am I and what makes me qualified to give this type of advice. My name is Yong Cheng, you can call me Low as well if you find that easier to pronounce. I have been writing code for about 5 years and working as a software engineer for 3 years. I am currently a Software Engineer at Glints. The reason why I started writing code is because of the amazing lecturers from Le Wagon Singapore. Their courses and knowledge shared during my Part Time Web Development Course really inspired me to make a career change from Hardware to Software! Over the next few days, I will be sharing web development articles on the following topics over the next few weeks: 1. Join the Scrum 2. It's Story Time 3.

However, it is important that we get this step right. By doing so, it will not only impress your technical assessors for your job application, but it will also ensure that your project will remain clean in the long run. For a short-term project, it is fine just to go to GitHub, create a repository, and call it done. However, in the long run, as more people work on the project, things start to change. As coding style differs, the code becomes harder and harder to read. As a new members join, they might be new to the language, hence using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with suggestions will be really helpful to them. In this Article, I will take you through a very basic project setup using, GitHub, VS Code, Ruby on Rails and Git. You may be using a different stack but similar principles will apply. All you will need is 1. A remote origin 2. An IDE 3. A Code Skeleton in any language 4. A version control system In order to ensure that we keep things focused, the next few articles will only contain a single concept. This will make things easier for people to follow along, it won't be like the Sprint Planning Series where one article has many ideas for a particular phase. Preparation If you want to follow along this project setup series, please setup your computer according to the following website. The setup instructions are courtesy of Le Wagon, I do teach there part time. If you are interested in their courses feel free to sign up. They have offices everywhere world wide. After that you can open your terminal and copy and paste the following. Replace &lt;YOURAPPNAME&gt; with your own application name. If you want you can call it myapp. Setting up VS Code Visual Studio Code is a widely used IDE for any language. Other IDE out there that companies commonly used include Intellij and Eclipse. You can use any IDE you want or prefer, but the concepts remain the same. The first step is to ensure that your IDE is set up for the language that you are going to code. We want to ensure that the setup process is the same for every team member so that when we pair program, things become a lot easier. For the case of VS Code, it is quite simple as VS Code allows us to add a folder to contain recommended extensions. We can also configure our VS Code really easily through a settings.json file. So long as everybody have the same JSON file, the IDE should remain consistent throughout all team members. Because we will be using Ruby on Rails, the extensions that I will introduce will be specific to the project. However, if you are using something such as NextJS, NodeJS, GoLang etc. a simple google search will allow you to find the recommended extension. For Ruby on Rails, there are many extensions that you project could include, however, for simplicity's sake I will introduce to you 5 types which most project will need: 1. Code Formatter (esbenp.prettier-vscode) 2. Language Beautifier (aliariff.vscode-erb-beautify) 3. Language Specific Suggestions (rayhanw.erb-helpers) 4. Collaboration Tools (ms-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) 5. Version Control Tools (eamodio.gitlens) A code formatter is used to format our code. This ensures that or coding style remains consistent throughout the project. For example, how we indent the code? Where should the brackets be? Should we end the line with trailing commas? Through the code formatter standardization, this makes the project look as if it was written by one person, which makes things easier to read, learn and write. It is also important that we turn on the format on save feature on, this ensures we don't have to waste time adjusting our coding style to match the required standard. A language beautifier allows the IDE to colorize the code correctly. Keywords such as const or let should be in a different color when you type them in a js file. Reserved words should also be in a different color to prevent weird variable naming errors. This ensure that the code is easy to read and reduce the chance of dirty code. A language specific suggester allows the IDE to give suggestions base on what the user is typing. To add on to this, a code generator can also be useful to install. For example when using Eclipse we can easily generate getters and setters when we code in Java. Plugins like these should be installed in every Java IDE to increase productivity. A collaboration tool allows us to easily collaborate with another user. This makes pair programming and debugging a lot easier. A version control tool such as gitlens will allow you to easily see who is the author of a particular line of code and when was it changed. This allow you to easily contact the person if there is a need for clarification or explanation. How to add VS Code Extensions In the root of your project, you can run the following code to create a VS Code extensions file. In the extensions.json file, you should add the extensions for your project. For those who are following along, you can copy the file information below After creating this file and adding the extensions, you may see VS Code prompting you to download and install some extensions if you haven't got it install. This means that the recommended extensions.json is working. Format on save Adjust your VS Code settings code > preferences > settings, add a , at the end of the file and paste the following code If there is a yellow squiggly line in your settings.json, most likely the code is repeated. Try to combine them or remove the duplicates. Conclusion To conclude, setting up a project is easy, doing it correctly it is hard. It is also important that we maintain a document on how we should setup a project and its configurations to make the onboarding process easier. This document will change overtime as a project grows, new plugins are introduced or removed to increase the code quality or increase productivity.","tags":["setup","ide","vscode","best-practices"],"date":"2022-03-16","url":"/blog/setting-up-your-project"},"single-source-of-truth":{"id":"single-source-of-truth","title":"Single Source of Truth","subtitle":"Creating a reliable Database","description":"Learn essential database design principles including constraints, normalization, and best practices for creating a reliable single source of truth for your web application.","content":"One of the most important software engineering principles is to ensure that we have a single source of truth. For the context of creating web applications, the single source of truth is the database. Therefore, designing a database to reliably store and manipulate data is one of our utmost priorities. To keep things simple for this beginner series, we will focus on a SQL Database. Examples will be given using an open-source Database Engine known as PostgreSQL. For other SQL Engines, e.g., Oracle, their syntax may slightly differ, however, the similar principles will apply. We will also be narrowing our scope to learn about database constraints and normalization. Other topics such as security and performance will be left for another day. Database constraints give you control over the data stored inside the tables In order to ensure that our database is the single source of truth, we need to ensure that our validations occur at the database level. This can be done by adding constraints to what we can store in our database through the different kinds of data types. Let's say we want to store a user's username into our database. We will be using a character varying data type. We can further strengthen the database validation by limiting the username to be a maximum of 50 characters long: Checks In addition to using the different data types that Postgres provides, we can also add additional constraints. Let's say we want to store the price of an item in the database. Logically speaking we would want to store the price as a non-negative number with 2 decimal places. We can achieve this in the following manner The numeric(5,2) allows us to have a maximum and minimum of 5 digits of which 2 are decimal points(-999.99 to 999.99) Primary Keys Primary Keys are a unique identifier for a row of data Primary keys are usually indexed automatically by the database to allow for fast access. For example, according to PostgreSQL documentation a B-Tree index is automatically created for primary keys. Foreign keys Foreign keys are references to a row with a primary key in another table For Foreign keys, there are additional behaviors that you can set when the primary key is deleted. | Action | Description | |--------|-------------| | NO ACTION (Default) | Referenced row will not be deleted | | RESTRICT | Prevents Deletion of Primary Key | | CASCADE | Referenced rows will be deleted as well | Not Null Not Null constraint does not allow null values It is important to note that null does not mean empty string. If you want to validate for a non-empty string, you need to add an additional length check. Unique Unique constraint means that every value in the column must be unique It is important to note that a unique contain can also be placed on multiple columns at the same time. For example, if we want to go back to our trustworthy AirBnB application, lets say we want to create a favorites table to store flats that the user saved. In order to prevent double insertions (saving to favorites twice), we add a unique constraint on userid and flatid sql StudentGradeReport (StudentId, Student, Major, Advisor, [Course, Grade]) sql Student (StudentId, Student, Major, Advisor) StudentCourse (StudentId, Course, Grade) bash Row1 = student, [course1, course2] User1 and User2 reads Row1 User1 Adds course3 to Row1 and press submit User2 Remove course2 to Row1 and press submit Result: Row1 = student, [course1] sql Student (StudentId, Student, Major, Advisor) StudentCourse (StudentId, CourseId, Grade) Course (CourseId, Course) sql Student (StudentId, Student) StudentMajor (StudentId, Major, Advisor) StudentCourse (StudentId, CourseId, Grade) Course (CourseId, Course) sql StudentMajor (StudentId, Advisor, Major) sql StudentAdvisor (StudentId, AdvisorId) AdvisorMajor (AdvisorId, Advisor, MajorId) Major (MajorId, Major) ``` By looking at the table above, we can now see. A student have an Advisor. An Advisor advises one major and a Major can have several advisors. Conclusion The database of our web application is our user's single source of truth. Therefore, we need to design it using the normalization rules to reduce redundancies and anomalies. To help developers, some companies employ a Database Administrator to approve the database design. In addition, although the advantages of database normalization cannot be seen immediately, an incorrectly designed database will result in huge re-writes in the future. This will hinder the development velocity of a particular product. It may also result in performance issues as the application scales to handle thousands if not millions of users. Now that we have covered the basics of backend design, I will be covering more of the frontend portion of the sprint planning in the following week.
