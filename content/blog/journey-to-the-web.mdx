So, you have just finished your coding bootcamp, got your degree or built your very own web application and you think you're ready to conquer the software engineering world. You go over to [Glints](https://glints.com), apply for a software engineering job and demand a 5k starting salary.

How Naive.

Don't worry, I was once like you! Having been in the industry for close to 3 years and helped close to 60 people get their first job in web development, I feel that it's a good time for me to share my experience to aspiring developers.

Don't get me wrong, your coding skills is important! However, your soft skills and how you present yourself during interviews is equally important. I have seen students who know their stuff inside out but they are just not good at selling themselves.

This series will be a guide, on how you can prepare for your first software engineering role. It will help you understand what hiring managers are looking for and how you can prepare for it.

Having been through the job hunting process myself, being involved in the hiring process with my company and teaching programming to aspiring developers, I will give you my perspective from 3 different angles.

Don't worry, we will go through this journey step by step. However before I start my web series, let me introduce myself so that you can understand who am I and what makes me qualified to give this type of advice.

My name is Yong Cheng, you can call me Low as well if you find that easier to pronounce. I have been writing code for about 5 years and working as a software engineer for 3 years. I am currently a Software Engineer at [Glints](https://glints.com/sg). The reason why I started writing code is because of the amazing lecturers from [Le Wagon Singapore](https://www.lewagon.com/singapore). Their courses and knowledge shared during my Part Time Web Development Course really inspired me to make a career change from Hardware to Software!

Over the next few days, I will be sharing web development articles on the following topics over the next few weeks:

1. Join the Scrum
2. It's Story Time
3. Single source of truth

If you are my hard core fan, you can check out the following [AirBnB repository](https://github.com/yongchenglow/airbnb-clone) and [Goal Setting repository](https://github.com/yongchenglow/goal-setting-app) that I will be using as examples. These are by far a finished products. I will enhance it as and when the content asks for it. Pardon me as I have a full time job and a part time teaching job. Unfortunately, this is it for now. Hope to see you join the Scrum!
