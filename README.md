## Git Conventions

feature/<branch_name>

hotfix/<branch_name>

### Commits

Refer to [commitlint.config.js](./commitlint.config.js) for prefixes to add for commits

```
<Keyword>: description
```

### Staging

Files that are staged will automatically go through eslint and prettier fix. Theses type of files are defined in lint-staged.config.js

## VSCode Setup

Install the recommended extensions inside the .vscode folder.
Adjust your VS Code settings `code > preferences > settings`, add a `,` at the end of the file and paste the following code

```
"editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
"editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
  "source.fixAll": true
},
```

If there is a yellow squigily line in your settings.json, most likely the code is repeated. Try to combine them.
