              you think is the first thing they do? Do they start by writing

              employers this should be the way things are done. Instead, you
              should be using this article to understand the different concepts
              and how they work. It is also important to understand that each
              team works a bit differently. Hence, they should adjust the Scrum
              framework to utilize the strength of all of their team members.

              A scrum team consist of a maximum of 10 people containing:
              <ul>
                <li>1 Product Owner</li>
                <li>1 Scrum Master</li>

              The <b>Product Owner</b> owns the product backlog or a to do list
              and makes executive product decisions based on the client and the
              business needs.

              The <b>Scrum master</b> is responsible to facilitate, advocate and
              coach the teams to ensure that the scrum teams are adhering to the
              scrum rules and are working at the stable velocity.

              The <b>Development Team</b> a self-organized team, consisting of
              many cross-functional members responsible for the development of
              the product. It is important to note that the development team
              does not only contain software engineers, but whoever is needed to
              complete the task at hand. Although this means that members can
              easily come and go, it is important to consider the loss in
              working velocity when onboarding a new member, or when losing
              someone with experience.

              Some of the more common roles that you may see in a Development
              Team includes:

                <li>Project Manager</li>
                <li>Designers</li>

                <li>Backend Engineer</li>
                <li>Frontend Engineer</li>
                <li>Security Engineer</li>
                <li>Devops Engineer</li>
                <li>Quality Assurance Engineer</li>
                <li>Hardware Engineer</li>
                <li>Data Scientist</li>

                <li>Architect</li>
              </ul>
              Each team member has a slightly different role and don't be
              surprised if a person has to take up multiple roles. It is also
              important to understand that a team does not need to consist of
              all the roles mentioned above. If you want to find out more about

              <b>Sprint Retrospective</b> is a meeting that allows the team to
              reflect on how they work over the past sprint. The 3 questions
              that the team have to answer are:
              <ol>
                <li>What went well?</li>
                <li>What didnâ€™t go so well?</li>
                <li>
                  What can we do differently to improve our working velocity in
                  the next sprint?
                </li>

              There are some companies that add additional rituals to ensure
              that the team can work at a stable velocity. These include:

              <b>Mid Sprint Review</b> is usually done at the middle of the
              sprint. This is to check if there are any risk of not being able
              to meet the sprint goal. If there are any, make the necessary
              adjustments.

              A <b>Tech Bounce</b> may be needed if the development team is not
              full of technical engineers. This session is basically taken out
              of the Sprint Planning time to align on the technical
              specifications such as the database design, Api request and
              response, frontend and backend validations etc. This ensures that
              the tech team is all on the same page so that frontend and backend
              can be built concurrently. Those that are not involved in the Tech
              Bounce will be doing their own version of Tech bounce, e.g.
              Designers, UX researchers will align on the Discovery Task and
              Hypothesis, QA may be planning out on what they need to do to
              strengthen the automation testing.

              <b>Tech Spike</b> may be done before the tech bounce to ensure the
              design of the tech for the current or next sprint is efficient and
              scalable. Some examples include database designs, optimizations to
              the web application, vulnerbility research etc.

              From my personal experience, I find the scrum rituals to be much
              more effective when working remotely. This is because at a remote
              workplace, everyone is usually working at their own pace,
              therefore the rituals serves as a common timing for us to check in
              on each other. In a physical workplace, especially if your team
              sits in the same room and constantly talks to each other, rituals
              such as the Daily Scrum may become ineffective.

              It is also important to note that although Scrum is one of the
              most popular ways of delivering a piece of software, there are
              other agile frameworks that a company may use. Some companies also
              don't adopt the agile workflow and prefer to work more towards{" "}

              So if your company decides how you work, how will this article
              help you? In my opinion, if you are given a take home assignment,
              joining a hackathon, or starting a new side project, the scrum
              framework is something that you should modify off to delivery
              software. How do you apply scrum in your projects? Well,
              unfortunately you will have to read the next few articles to find
              out.

              In conclusion, I have scraped the surface of what is Scrum, what
              the teams are made up of and the different rituals that a team
              will follow. The next few articles will be focused around Sprint
              Planning. These will include user stories, database design and
              wireframes before we move on to the actual coding stuff. For those
              of you who are die hard coders, I ask for you all to bear with me
              a little while longer. It is important to understand that{" "}
              <strong>
                the industry is moving away from focusing on the speed of
                delivery, and focusing more on the quality of the delivery
              </strong>
              . From your coding bootcamp or university education you should be
              able to see that creating a web application is easy, but the
              question is,{" "}
              <strong>
                how do we write code that is clean, efficient and scalable

              ? That is something you have to stay around to find out.
